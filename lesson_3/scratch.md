Feedback on tic-tac-toe:

1. You can use flattening to reduce the nested loops.
2. Don't have to rely on specifying coordinates - e.g. when generating the
   winning rows and columns.
3. Can simplify the logic if you rely on the board being a square. E.g. use
   matrix operations

Study session with Antonina. 15 November 2023

- Valerie
- Robert
- Fuad Three different assessments. 109d is different from 119.
- Written:
  - 109d is 20 questions, 3 hours.
  - 119 is 10 questions, 2 hours.
  - You get code plus questions to go with it.
- Interview:
  - 2 problems to solve, you have one hours
  - looking to see the problem-solving process
  - make test cases, extract implicit requirements, create an algorithm
  - code is just the translation of the solution into code
  - algorithm should start very high level - maybe just 3 steps, then can go
    into more detail.
  - data structures - just think about what you're going to use.
  - focus a lot on communication

for .filter, don't say that it "returns" an array. Say it selects the elements
or something like that. Callback function returns a result to the higher-order
function (like map, filter, etc.)

remember statements vs. expressions
